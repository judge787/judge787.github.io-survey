Group receives $3,786,000 in federal funding to improve multi-scale greenhouse emissions modelling from urban environments to enhance mitigation strategies.
University of Guelph researchers including College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS) professor Dr. Amir Aliabadi 
and Ontario Agricultural College (OAC) professor Dr. E. Scott Krayenhoff are fighting climate change and mitigating its 
catastrophic consequences. Drs. Aliabadi and Krayenhoff are working on a University of Western Ontario project that has received 
funding in part by the Government of Canada's Climate Action and Awareness Fund. Dr. Kamran Siddique, as the Principal Investigator, 
will work to improve the accuracy of building and climate models. The Climate Action and Awareness Fund, created under 
the Environmental Damages Fund, will provide up to $206 million over five years to support Canadian-made projects that help to 
reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.

Do you think that paper citation records are related to the success or impact of a researcher? Nowadays paper citations are a source for both fame and anxiety for many researchers.
Interpreting the citation records in relation to the success or impact of a researcher is very difficult. Recently the top 100 most-cited papers were analyzed in a <i> Nature </i> article by van Noorden et al. in 2014.
There is evidence that a mountain of papers published attract no or only few citations, even those that made significant contributions to various fields of science. The top 100 most-cited papers did not mainly relate to new 
discoveries; the vast majority describe experimental methods or software that have become essential in their fields. Do you care about citation records?

Amir A. Aliabadi is serving as a guest editor for the <i>Atmosphere</i> journal for a special issue titled: <i>Transport Phenomena in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer</i>.
In the context of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL), transport phenomena refer to the exchanges of momentum (wind velocity components), energy (temperature), 
and mass (water vapor, natural atmospheric constituents such as ozone, carbon dioxide, and inert gases, as well as gaseous and particulate pollutants). 
Such phenomena within ABL are not well understood due to complex physical and chemical processes that are ever-present in the ABL. 
Transport phenomena can be studied in either the Eulerian or Lagrangian frameworks. This special issue of <i>Atmosphere</i> invites research articles centered around 
understanding transport phenomena within the ABL from experimental, analytical, and numerical points of view across the scales from micro to meso scales. 
Preference will be given to articles that investigate transport phenomena within the ABL at some level of fundamental and mathematical depth.

Canadian accomplishments in science and scholarly inquiry have long been a source of national pride. However, by various measures, Canada's research competitiveness has eroded in recent years when compared with international peers. The change coincided with a period of flat-lining of federal spending through the four core funding agencies that support researchers in universities, colleges, institutes, and research hospitals. In those years funds were also directed preferentially to priority-driven and partnership oriented research, reducing available support for independent, investigator-led research by frontline scientists and scholars. Read the report by "Canada's Fundamental Science Review Panel" to address relevant issues in this area. The report is titled "Investing in Canada's Future: Strengthening the Foundations of Canada's Research".

Science Exposed is a contest organized by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and devoted exclusively to images of scientific research, in all fields of study. In 2016, NSERC was proud to collaborate with the Association francophone pour le savoir (Acfas) and open La preuve par l'image to candidates all across Canada. Acfas is responsible for the Francophone segment of the contest, La prevue par l'image, and NSERC is responsible for the Anglophone segment, Science Exposed. Students are encouraged to participate in this contest.

Professor John P.A. Ioannidis at Stanford University has published a critical essay about why many research findings that are published cannot be trusted to report the truth. The essay is titled "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False ".

We are living in an age of innovation, an unprecedented era of technological progress and prosperity driven by energy. However, most of this energy comes from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas that account for a majority of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We know that CO2 emissions are a leading contributor to climate change, and the world will need a portfolio of solutions to address this Grand Challenge. The $20M NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE will challenge the world to reimagine what we can do with CO2 emissions by incentivizing and accelerating the development of technologies that convert CO2 into valuable products. These technologies have the potential to transform how the world approaches CO2 mitigation, and reduce the cost of managing CO2.

During the last decade, engineering programs have been growing most rapidly in Canadian universities. In this light, it is worth understanding the engineering job market as well. The Ontario Society for Professional Engineers (OSPE) has just published a report to address this. The report "Crisis in Ontario's Engineering Labour Market: Underemployment Among Ontario's Engineering-Degree Holders" focuses on individuals with engineering degrees who are working in jobs that don't necessarily require a university degree.
